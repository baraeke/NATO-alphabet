# NATO Alphabet Game 🇺🇸🔤

This is a fun and educational Python project from Day 26 of the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**. The game converts a user's input (word) into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet.

## 📌 How It Works

- The program asks the user to input a word.
- It then uses the NATO phonetic alphabet to convert each letter of the word into its phonetic code word.
- For example:  
  **"Hello" → ['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']**
